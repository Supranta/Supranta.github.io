I am interested in various aspects of large-scale structure cosmology. I am interested in using novel statistical tools and better modelling of the large-scale structure to optimally extract cosmological information from it. You can find more about my research interests in the [research](/research/) page.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Arizona Cosmology Lab](http://azcosmolab.org/). I finished my PhD at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) under the supervision of [Mike Hudson](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/people-profiles/michael-hudson) and [Ghazal Geshnizjani](https://ghazalgeshnizjani.wordpress.com/). Before that, I completed my BS-MS dual degree at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in/).
