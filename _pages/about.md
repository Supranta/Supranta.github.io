I am a [Center for Particle Cosmology](https://particlecosmo.sas.upenn.edu/) fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I work on developing statistical and machine learning methods for cosmological analysis. I am interested in various aspects of large-scale structure cosmology. Currently, my main research focus is on developing field-level analysis methods for weak lensing data. I have also developed fast machine-learning based emulators for 3x2 pt analysis and have worked on extracting cosmological information from peculiar velocity data. 
 
I am interested in various aspects of large-scale structure cosmology. I am interested in using novel statistical tools and better modelling of the large-scale structure to optimally extract cosmological information from it. You can find more about my research interests in the [research](/research/) page.

Previosly, I was a postdoc at the [Arizona Cosmology Lab](http://azcosmolab.org/). I finished my PhD at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) under the supervision of [Mike Hudson](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/people-profiles/michael-hudson) and [Ghazal Geshnizjani](https://ghazalgeshnizjani.wordpress.com/). Before that, I completed my BS-MS dual degree at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in/).
