I am interested in different aspects of data-driven observational cosmology. Some of these topics are forward-modelled reconstruction of the large-scale structure, study of the peculiar velocity. I show some cool plots and animations related to my research below.

**Forward-modelled reconstruction of the large-scale structure:**

I am a member of the [Aquila consortium](https://www.aquila-consortium.org/), which uses forward-modelled reconstruction and novel statistical methods to study the large-scale structure of the universe. Shown below is an animation of the density field inferred from applying the BORG software to a mock galaxy catalog. The galaxy data is concentrated in the middle which constrains the dark matter density fairly well. But at the edges, where the data is lacking, you can see the fluctuations in the density samples.

**Peculiar Velocity:**

In a [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.xxxxx), we compared the predicted velocities from the large scale structures to the observed velocities to constrain the cosmological parameter, $$f\sigma_8$$ and the bulk flow in the local universe. A map of the reconstructed radial velocities in the supergalactic plane is shown below.

We also compiled a new compilation of low redshift supernovae to use as a peculiar velocity survey. Having derived from the _First amendment_ catalog, we call our compilation the _Second Amendment_ supernovae compilation ().

**Gravitational wave cosmology:**

I am also interested in using gravitational wave observations to constrain the cosmological model in the universe. In an ongoing work, we are trying to constrain the Hubble constant from a combination of gravitational wave catalog and a galaxy catalog.

**Theoretical early Universe cosmology:**

Previously, I have also worked on theoretical aspects of early universe cosmology. We [studied a modification to gravity called Cuscuton in the early universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01131) and proposed an [alternative to Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06818) based on it.
