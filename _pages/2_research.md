I am interested in different aspects of data-driven observational cosmology.

**Field-level inference for weak lensing data**

**Fast emulators for weak lensing and galaxy clustering analysis**

**Peculiar Velocity analysis in the local Universe:**

During my PhD, I studied the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This is important for two reasons: i) We can infer the growth rate of structure ($$f\sigma_8$$) from these observations. ii) Peculiar velocities are a source of systematic errors in the measurement of the expansion rate ($$H_0$$).

In [one of our papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09383.pdf), we obtained constraints on $$f\sigma_8$$ which is competitive with other probes of structure growth (See the figure below).

In [another recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01119.pdf), we investigated the role peculiar velocity errors plays in the inference of $$H_0$$.

**Weak-lensing:**

I am currently working on a project to infer cosmological parameters from weak-lensing maps at a field-level. This has the potential of tightening the cosmological constraints by taking advantagge of the full information present in the weak-lensing data.

I am also interested in combined cosmological analysis of weak lensing and spectroscopic data.

**Gravitational wave cosmology:**

I am also interested in developing frameworks for measuring $$H_0$$ by using cross-correlations of GW data sets with galaxies.

**Theoretical early Universe cosmology:**

Previously, I have also worked on theoretical aspects of early universe cosmology. We [studied a modification to gravity called Cuscuton in the early universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01131) and proposed an [alternative to Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06818) based on it.
