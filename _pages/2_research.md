I am interested in different aspects of data-driven observational cosmology.

**Peculiar Velocity analysis in the local Universe:**

I am interested in studying the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This is important for two reasons: i) We can infer the cosmological parameter, $$f\sigma_8$$ from these observations. ii) Peculiar velocities are an import source of systematic errors in the measurement of $$H_0$$. I am interested in both of these.

In [one of our papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09383.pdf), we obtained constraints on $$f\sigma_8$$ which is competitive with other probes of structure growth (See the figure below).

In [another recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01119.pdf), we investigated the role peculiar velocity errors plays in the inference of $$H_0$$.

**Forward-modelled reconstruction:**

I am a member of the [Aquila consortium](https://aquila-consortium.org/) where we think about a novel method of reconstructing the Universe by forward-modelling the structure formation in the Universe. I am particularly interested in the reconstruction of the local Universe and modelling the peculiar velocity in the local Universe using this interesting approach.

The following animation shows the density sampling in a mock galaxy survey as inferred by the BORG algorithm.

**Weak-lensing:**

I am currently working on a project to infer cosmological parameters from weak-lensing maps at a field-level. This has the potential of tightening the cosmological constraints by taking advantagge of the full information present in the weak-lensing data.

I am also interested in combined cosmological analysis of weak lensing and spectroscopic data.

**Gravitational wave cosmology:**

I am also interested in developing frameworks for measuring $$H_0$$ by using cross-correlations of GW data sets with galaxies.

**Theoretical early Universe cosmology:**

Previously, I have also worked on theoretical aspects of early universe cosmology. We [studied a modification to gravity called Cuscuton in the early universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01131) and proposed an [alternative to Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06818) based on it.
