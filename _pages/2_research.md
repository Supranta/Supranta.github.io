I am interested in different aspects of data-driven observational cosmology. More specifically, I am interested in large-scale structure and multimessenger cosmology.

**Peculiar Velocity:** Peculiar velocities are a unique probe of the large-scale structure at low redshifts. In a [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.xxxxx), we compared the predicted velocities from the large scale structures to the observed velocities to constrain the cosmological parameter, $$f\sigma_8$$ and the bulk flow in the local universe. A map of the radial velocities in the supergalactic plane is shown below.

We also compiled a new compilation of low redshift supernovae to use as a peculiar velocity survey. We call this survey the _Second Amendment_ supernovae compilation.

**Forward-modelled reconstruction of the large-scale structure:**
