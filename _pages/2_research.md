I am interested in different aspects of data-driven observational cosmology. This includes Bayesian reconstruction of

**Peculiar Velocity:**


**Forward-modelled reconstruction of the large-scale structure:**

<!-- **Non-linear bias models**

**Gravitational wave cosmology:**

<!-- I am also interested in using gravitational wave observations to constrain the cosmological model in the universe. In an ongoing work, we are trying to constrain the Hubble constant from a combination of gravitational wave catalog and a galaxy catalog. -->

<!-- **Bayesian Inference and Machine Learning:** -->

**Theoretical early Universe cosmology:**

<!-- Previously, I have also worked on theoretical aspects of early universe cosmology. We [studied a modification to gravity called Cuscuton in the early universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01131) and proposed an [alternative to Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06818) based on it. -->
